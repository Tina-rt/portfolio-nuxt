  Hi, I'm **Tina Hubert RATOLOJANAHARY**, a Software Developer based in Antananarivo, Madagascar. With over 2 years of experience in frontend and full-stack development, I focus on creating robust and user-friendly digital solutions.

  My expertise lies in **TypeScript**, **Python**, **Vue.js**, and **NuxtJS**. I enjoy the process of turning complex requirements into elegant, functional code. Whether it's crafting interactive user interfaces or building efficient data processing pipelines, I'm always eager to take on new challenges.

  ### My Technical Expertise

  I have a strong foundation in modern web technologies:
  - **Frontend**: Vue.js, NuxtJS, React, Tailwind CSS.
  - **Backend**: Node.js (Express, NestJS), Python (Django, FastAPI, Flask), PHP (Laravel).
  - **Database & Tools**: PostgreSQL, Supabase, Firebase, Docker, AWS.

  ### Seeking New Horizons

  Currently, I am working as a Frontend VueJS Developer at **The Greenshot**, based in Belgium (working remotely). I am actively seeking international opportunities where I can apply my skills in full-stack development and contribute to impactful projects on a global scale.

  ### Education & Background

  I hold a **Master in Information Management System** from INSI Antananarivo and a **Bachelor in Computer Science** from ASJA Antsirabe. This academic background, combined with my professional experience, has equipped me with a deep understanding of software engineering principles and agile methodologies.
